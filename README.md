# X-ray Spectral Analysis of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31)

This project focuses on analyzing Chandra X-ray Observatory data of the central region of M31 to study unresolved X-ray emission. 

## Project Highlights
- Processed archival ACIS-S and ACIS-I observations of M31 using CIAO tools
- Removed point sources to isolate unresolved emission
- Estimated background signal with blanksky files
- Extracted and modeled spectra
  
## Tools Used
- CIAO (Chandra Interactive Analysis of Observations)
- DS9 for image and region file handling
- Python (`astropy`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, etc.)
- Shell scripting
